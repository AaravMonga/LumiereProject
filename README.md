## Information

This repo contains the code used in the research project titled "A For-profit Model of Microcredit: Can Profit-driven Firms Improve Financial Inclusion in India?"

## Data
Data is sourced from the MIX Markets database of Microfinance Institutions (MFIs); MFIs in India or economically comparable regions are included.
The following features are extracted from the database: Number of Loan Officers, Gross Loan Portfolio, Number of Active Borrowers, Number of Loans Outstanding, Short Term Delinquency, Long term Delinquency, Average Loan per Borrower, Cost per Borrower, Borrowers per Loan Officer, Profit. 7 additional engineered features are included.
All features are normalized.

## Benchmark


## Proposed Model / Algorithm

Motivation: based on the above discussion, provide a summary of the drawback. In order to solve this problem, we propose XXXXXX. 

## Application

### Algorithm

How you use your proposed method in this particular data set? Sometimes people call Experimental Design.

- how do you train your model?
- how do you test your model? 

### Results

Provide a table(s) or graph(s) of lab results or prediction performance.

## Conclusion

- First provide a summary of the entire paper
- Then expand to forward looking statement and call for new related ideas based on your research
