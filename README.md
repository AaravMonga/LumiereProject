## Information

[Fill-in: Give a one sentence summary of the github repo]

## Data

This is the section we introduce data. 
- provide summary statistics (one paragraph)
- plot / visualization / EDA (exploratory data analysis) <= use visualization to help people understand [name of the link](https://google.com)

## Benchmark

Two potential directions:

(1) Suppose you are interested in a particular data. Check whether others have tried this data before. How did they do it? And what is the performance?

(2) Suppose you are interested in a methodology, say neural network. Check what are the famous data sets that people use neural network on. This section will discuss those famous examples as benchmark. 

Pinpoint: what is the pitfall/drawback of the benchmark?

## Proposed Model / Algorithm

Motivation: based on the above discussion, provide a summary of the drawback. In order to solve this problem, we propose XXXXXX. 

## Application

### Algorithm

How you use your proposed method in this particular data set? Sometimes people call Experimental Design.

- how do you train your model?
- how do you test your model? 

### Results

Provide a table(s) or graph(s) of lab results or prediction performance.

## Conclusion

- First provide a summary of the entire paper
- Then expand to forward looking statement and call for new related ideas based on your research
